## Rabbit Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Rabbit family! 🐰

We’re thrilled to have you on board. Your privacy is super important to us, and we want you to feel confident and secure while using our awesome features. Here’s a quick and friendly rundown of how we handle your information.

### Your Privacy, Our Priority

- **Transparency**: We're all about being open and honest with you.
- **No Trading**: Your info stays safe with us – we don’t trade or sell it.
- **Minimal Data**: We only keep what we need to make Rabbit work its magic.
- **User Control**: You’ve got the power! Request a copy of your data or ask us to delete it anytime.

### What We Collect

- **Server Data**: We store server IDs to manage our premium system.
- **Channel Data**: We keep channel IDs for cool features like 24/7 music.
- **User Data**: We store user IDs for our premium system and no-prefix commands.

### How Long We Keep It

We hang on to your data as long as it's needed for Rabbit to do its thing or until you ask us to delete it. If you remove Rabbit from your server, we stop collecting data from that server right away.

### Sharing is Caring, but Only When Necessary

Your data is precious to us, and we won’t share it with third parties unless it's absolutely necessary:

- **Online Database**: We use MongoDB to store Rabbit’s data securely. Check out MongoDB's Privacy Policy for more info.

### Delete Your Data: Easy Peasy

Want your data gone? No problem! Just hop into our support Discord server and message a developer with your Discord User ID. Remember, deleting certain data might disable some features, and removing premium data could deactivate your servers without a refund. You can request data deletion once every 30 days.
